This is the R package for CWLS (Corrected Weighted Least Squares) and CWBLS (Corrected Weighted Bivariate Least Squares), a desgined method to adjust for collider bias in Mendelian Randomisation.

For detail of our methods, please refer to our paper of [CWLS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35583096/). The paper of CWBLS is still under review.
