Description: This package provides adjustment for collider bias and weak instrument bias in association statistics in the context of a genome-wide association study for a subsequent event, using CWLS (Corrected Weighted Least Squares), MR-RAPS and Slope Hunter. An estimation of true causal effect between disease progression and an exposure of interest can be computed using two-step regression.
