Description: This package provides adjustment for collider bias and weak
    instrument bias in association statistics in the context of a
    genome-wide association study for a subsequent event, using CWLS
    (Corrected Weighted Least Squares), MR-RAPS and Slope Hunter. An
    estimation of true causal effect between disease progression and an
    exposure of interest can be computed using generalised instrument effect
    regression with CWBLS (Corrected Weighted Bivariate Least Squares).
