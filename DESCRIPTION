Description: This package provides adjustment for collider bias and weak
    instrument bias in association statistics in the context of a
    genome-wide association study for a subsequent event, using CWLS
    (Corrected Weighted Least Squares), MR-RAPS and Slope Hunter. An
    estimation of true causal effect between disease progression and an
    exposure of interest can be computed using two-step regression.
